# APM Plugins

APM plugins are used by the autoscaler to interact with an external APM system,
returning metrics that are used by the autoscaler to inform scaling actions.

For a real-world example of a Nomad APM plugin implementation, see the
[Prometheus plugin](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad-autoscaler/tree/main/plugins/builtin/apm/prometheus).

## Authoring APM Plugins

Authoring a device plugin in Go can be accomplished by implementing the
[apm.APM][apm_plugin] interface, alongside a main package to launch the plugin.

The [no-op APM plugin][noop_plugin] can be used as a starting point for new APM
plugins.

## APM Plugin API

The [base plugin][base_plugin] interface must be implemented in addition to the
following functions.

### `Query(query string, timeRange sdk.TimeRange) (sdk.TimestampedMetrics, error)`

The `Query` [function][fingerprintfn] is called by the agent during policy
evaluation. The `query` argument is the opaque string from the scaling policy,
and the `timeRange` indicates the period of time over which the query should be
made. The returned metrics are passed to the configured strategy plugin as part
of the policy evaluation.

### `QueryMultiple(query string, timeRange sdk.TimeRange) ([]sdk.TimestampedMetrics, error)`

The `QueryMultiple` method is only by Dynamic Application Scaling.
